## Summary
Aircraft have long been utilizing reliable but heavy and limited capability sensors to identify their flight state (speed, flight angle, etc.). We present an integrated system that includes a low-profile network of sensors embedded into the aerodynamic surface of an aircraft wing and a set of specialized AI models fed by the data obtained from these sensors. We demonstrate that our system can predict the most commonly sought-after flight data as well as safety-critical conditions with very high accuracy, paving the way for a novel aircraft instrumentation method.
